## Geosprocket Geodata
Taking Github's new [GeoJSON mapping capabilities](https://help.github.com/articles/mapping-geojson-files-on-github) for a spin with some large datasets . . .

### Note on the VT Cadastral Dataset 
This is provided AS IS, 2 steps of derived data removed from the original town tax maps, which were released to the public domain as indicated in the "year" field. Thanks to the VT Agency of Natural Resources for compiling this, but it was a one-time deal and will probably be out of date tomorrow . . .
